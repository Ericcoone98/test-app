        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently a Collision Technician, I started learning to code as a hobby with the goal to 
            use these skills to create tools for the automotive industry, and to eventually transition into a
            career in software development. <br><br>
        
            This web page is a simple test application to help understand basic 
            functions such as creating a log in and register page, learning how to use JavaScript to create
            a simple web application, the use of Ai (github copilot) to help with the coding process, 
            learn how to host a webpage with vercel, use supabase to create a database, and to learn how to
            use github for code management.<br><br>
        
            My years in automotive repair have taught me the importance of attention to detail, how to problem solve,
            and how to search for resources when problems have little to no information available; I am working towardss
            combining these skills with my new coding skills to create tools that will help the automotive industry 
            with customer service, and to help technicians have access to the information they need to do their jobs in
            a fast and efficient manner.<br><br>
        
            My future plans include creating a lead generation tool to create side work, a tool to help mom and pop shops 
            have better communication with customers, create software that makes the estimating process faster and more efficient, 
            and to eventually create a tool to help technicians find resources and guides all in one place.<br><br>
        
            outside of the automotive industry I am interested in creating software that help others like myself
            find side work and creates leads for small businesses, and to create software that helps people find 
            returning clients.
