        <p>
                I am currently a Collision Technician, I started learning to code as a hobby with the goal to 
            use these skills to create tools for the automotive industry, and to eventually transition into a
            career in software development. 
            <br>
                This web page is a simple test application to help understand basic 
            functions such as creating a log in and register page, learning how to use JavaScript to create
            a simple web application, the use of Ai (github copilot) to help with the coding process, 
            learn how to host a webpage with vercel, use supabase to create a database, and to learn how to
            use github for code management.
            <br>
                My years in automotive repair have taught me the importance of attention to detail, how to problem solve,
                and how to search for resources when problems have little to no information available.
